	abstract = {A double pendulum consists of one pendulum attached to another.  Double pendula are an example of a simple physical system which can exhibit chaotic behavior.  Consider a double bob pendulum with masses m\_1 and m\_2 attached by rigid massless wires of lengths l\_1 and l\_2. Further, let the angles the two wires make with the vertical be denoted {\textbackslash}theta\_1 and {\textbackslash}theta\_2, as illustrated above.  Finally, let gravity be given by g. Then the positions of the bobs are given by  x\_1 = l\_1{\textbackslash}sin{\textbackslash}theta\_1 y\_1 =...},

	abstract = {A double pendulum is undoubtedly an actual miracle of nature. The jump in complexity, which is observed at the transition from a simple pendulum to a double pendulum is amazing. The oscillations of a simple pendulum are regular. For small deviations from equilibrium, these oscillations are harmonic and can be described by sine or cosine ... Read more},

	abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) was built to detect and observe gravity waves, whose existence was predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity. A critical part of the interferometer are the mirrors which reﬂect the laser beams, and whose motion determines if a gravity wave is present. As of 2001, LIGO was slated to update their facility by housing each mirror on the lowest bob of a quadruple pendulum to reduce thermal noise.},

	abstract = {Incorporating an innovative modeling approach, this book for a one-semester differential equations course emphasizes conceptual understanding to help users relate information taught in the classroom to real-world experiences. Certain models reappear throughout the book as running themes to synthesize different concepts from multiple angles, and a dynamical systems focus emphasizes predicting the long-term behavior of these recurring models. Users will discover how to identify and harness the mathematics they will use in their careers, and apply it effectively outside the classroom.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.},

	isbn = {978-1-119-44376-6},
	abstract = {Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 11e, like its predecessors, is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, whose interest in differential equations may sometimes be quite theoretical, sometimes intensely practical, and often somewhere in between. The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two or three semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.},

	title = {Introduction to {Applied} {Nonlinear} {Dynamical} {Systems} and {Chaos}},
	isbn = {978-0-387-21749-9},
	abstract = {Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modern as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in - search and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM). The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high level of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as nume- cal and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mat- matical Sciences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research-level monographs. Pasadena, California J.E. Marsden Providence, Rhode Island L. Sirovich College Park, Maryland S.S. Antman Preface to the Second Edition This edition contains a signi?cant amount of new material. The main r- son for this is that the subject of applied dynamical systems theory has seen explosive growth and expansion throughout the 1990s. Consequently, a student needs a much larger toolbox today in order to begin research on signi?cant problems.},

	abstract = {Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos, Second Edition, provides a rigorous yet accessible introduction to differential equations and dynamical systems. The original text by three of the world's leading mathematicians has become the standard textbook for graduate courses in this area. Thirty years in the making, this Second Edition brings students to the brink of contemporary research, starting from a background that includes only calculus and elementary linear algebra. The book explores the dynamical aspects of ordinary differential equations and the relations between dynamical systems and certain fields outside pure mathematics. It presents the simplification of many theorem hypotheses and includes bifurcation theory throughout. It contains many new figures and illustrations; a simplified treatment of linear algebra; detailed discussions of the chaotic behavior in the Lorenz attractor, the Shil'nikov systems, and the double scroll attractor; and increased coverage of discrete dynamical systems. This book will be particularly useful to advanced students and practitioners in higher mathematics.
